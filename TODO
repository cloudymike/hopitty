Where to start
===============

See issues on github


For javascript example
-----------------------


##### Post for getting one appliance status
Instead of getting them all just get one at a time. Use different times for different services

##### Initialize and reset with timer time
For inactive appliances, update slowly and for active frequently
Check state shift frequently (should be quick check)
If state shift reinitialize to reset timers

##### Create one graphic, termometer, heat, pump, volume
