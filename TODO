Where to start
===============

See issues on github

Flag for simulation and progress through appliance switch and sensor


For javascript example
-----------------------

##### Progress bar
For timer, some graph. Progress bar is probably most suitable.

##### Orgchart for flow
Slightly contrived, but intersting to try. parent -> flow -> child

##### Status for Run, stop, paused
##### Status for error

Javascript for reals
--------------------

Create api for the real server and add a MVP page
Probably easist to just start with thermometers.
