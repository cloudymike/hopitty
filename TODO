Where to start
===============

See issues on github


For javascript example
-----------------------

##### Progress bar
For timer, some graph. Progress bar is probably most suitable.

##### Orgchart for flow
Slightly contrived, but intersting to try. parent -> flow -> child

##### Status for Run, stop, paused
##### Status for error

Javascript for reals
--------------------

Create api for the real server and add a MVP page
Probably easist to just start with thermometers.

##### Create the python page
Create a chart.py that load up the java scripts, though all commented out for now
until we start to add stuff

##### Create API for stage (MVP?)
This should be straigt forward, just calling:
    # stage = s2b.getStage()
Comment out the drawVolChart and drawChart for now from state.jsref

#### Temperature API
Ensure this is an efficient api as it will be hit frequently

##### Add temperature charts
Update refresh values in tGauge.js to be apropriate (and a lot slower than current) 10s 100s?
