Where to start
===============

See issues on github


For javascript example
-----------------------

##### Include script from other file?
Right now all the scripts are in one blob, would be nice to do includes
I guess this is just in the html file.

##### Progress bar
For timer, some graph. Progress bar is probably most suitable.

##### Add for reals
Create api for the real server and add a MVP page
Probably easist to just start with thermometers.
