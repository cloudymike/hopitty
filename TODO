This should be done in checker

use controller.load for ctrlmain
  Requires derived classes for alternative appliance modules

Test all basic functions of appliances
get
set
measure
...

add connectSensor, similar to connectSwitch


usage on ctrl.py

Move all tests to src/tests

Breakout classes and defs from ctrl.py

Break out getop and use an options dictionary

Make hwtun sim a true subclass of hwhw. Cleanup ctrl permissive mode

use same class for sim and hw
pass object HW or sim to class above
  switch
  sensor

Checks
  mutex (link to other controller that should NOT be activated at same time)
  max values (as pump volume)
  Timeouts?
  watch dogs? Water checks?

dict_.get('key2', "Key doesn't exist")
