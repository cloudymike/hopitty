Where to start
===============

Pretty much all the action is in parseBSMX
The temperature is checked and set there, with an override value so
the strike temp will be either calculated or the one from BSMX file.

Status tests passed

Next figure out a test setup to compare beersmith calc temp with program calc
Set measured temp to BSMX temp
Run calculation
Check strike temps

Seems like a separate test program but iterating over all recipies
As it uses bsmx calc it could stay.

Check recipeReader.strikeTemp
This function was useful to build on, but I have no clue why it is there. 
The only place it seems to be used is in src/recipeModel/tests/testMashInT.py
