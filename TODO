Where to start
===============

See issues on github

### runraw and runcomm
Make sure they run properly and add tests.

### Pythonize
Pythonize polulu, see See this page:
https://github.com/frc4564/maestro

Fix or remove matplotlib. Maybe use pandas/plotly express web server from brewlog

### Python 3


### Decouple controlller entanglement, use data files (deal with controllerinfo)


###Flag for simulation and progress through appliance switch and sensor


For javascript example
-----------------------

##### Progress bar
For timer, some graph. Progress bar is probably most suitable.

##### Orgchart for flow
Slightly contrived, but intersting to try. parent -> flow -> child

##### Status for Run, stop, paused
##### Status for error

Javascript for reals
--------------------

Create api for the real server and add a MVP page
Probably easist to just start with thermometers.
