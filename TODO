On timefractions branch
  combine simulation and real class in hoptime now that 
  fractions are used in hoptimer class

write boiler class

run with partial hardware, in particular without the x10 on

Allow hardware to fail in permissive mode, and switch to simulation mode

Breakout classes and defs from ctrl.py

Break out getop and use an options dictionary

Make hwtun sim a true subclass of hwhw. Cleanup ctrl permissive mode

use same class for sim and hw
pass object HW or sim to class above
  switch
  sensor

Checks
  mutex (link to other controller that should NOT be activated at same time)
