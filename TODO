Where to start
===============


Test HW, verify that all USB hardware sensors and controllers are connected 
and can be attached to by the software.

In mashProfiles, break out water heating and sparging, as this is the same for all
current mash profiles.

UscCmd failing in 64 bit. Add this code in Program.cs:
try
{
  listDevices();
}
catch
{
  return;
}

create a minmax water checker using BSMX input.
There is a start of one in mashProfiles.py. checkVolBsmx
More in last mash profile
Break this one out as a def and reuse. Maybe use in ctrl.rununit.checkBSMX.
Right now it always returns true as tests are failing.

Created a checker for min max water but it is not considering water used by grain.
Maybe break out function in parseBSMX. Make 18StoneRuination fail. Did not work so remove.

There is no way to see what recipe is selected until you push the start
button

dataMemcache: create nosetests for all methods. write-read-compare. Validate type of data

Create a maintenance programs module that is similar to recipeliststatus, but
reading the json files instead.

Add test button to runcontrol page. This will do a quick run and reality check of the recipe.

titles on stages page are not ordered, create some basic order, alphabetic OK

====== Less immediate =====
stages should probably be a class
Remove unused code
    Commented out code
    import statements with yellow triangle

coverage
--------
  covertests
  Start with all files not listed, should they be removed?
  Create a nosetests only option of covertests
  Identify lines not covered, add nosetests or remove or mark as not testable
     hardware lines. try to minimize the amount




====== Post brew issues and observations =======

Added cold water to hot water tun after mashin. This dropped the temperature and added 30 min to the mash cycle.

Siphoning from the mashtun to the boiler during sparging. Ended up with 3.8 gallons preboil so probably 2 quarts too much.

Needed to put this beer on hold, at the boiling stage. The  boil had just started but brought down to 190F (3 on burner) The first hops where however already added.

First use of aluminum pot,  The burner was turning off at setting  5, indicating bad contact between pot and burner. Seems to work OK after I moved the pot. This lead to slow heating to boil.

The new pot does not have a lip so pouring out of the pot lead to spilling about a quart of wort. Changed to siphoning instead.



==04/20/2013

Get all USB commands to work without sudo

Better holder for hose into boiler pot. The hose must be above the surface so no
siphoning will be happening. 

Better error messages when a recipe file is not properly provided. Try, as example
   ./runscan.py ../recipe/x10test
 This should have been -f but still tries to read a file and then fail
Also try reading in file with runscan.py from user that does not have one (as root)

Brewstages, as page is larger than one screen, every refresh pops page to top.  Fix for now, 
slow the page refresh to something like 15s or 30s.

The wort pump was running dry. It was close, was at 5.4 gallon, it should have been 5.47.
For now raise the volume used for equipment in recipe. Add check for equipment volume and total
volume in and out in checkers. Move from parseBSMX

=== 04/10/2013 
stages page has a links for number, why?
DTHe blue on green does not work.

== after brew 130202
Post cleaning not working as it relies on scale.

== after brew 130126

Add key mashing data to mash status page from recipe
  Equipment temperature
  (mash schedule..)

===== Hardware Issues =====
X10 controller hangs at startup at times. Debug this. It seems like a reboot
fixes the problem.

Consider create a HW check mode, that will fail if not all hardware sensors and 
controllers are OK


==== Checks =====
  mutex (link to other controller that should NOT be activated at same time)
  max values (as pump volume)
  Timeouts?
  watch dogs? Water checks?
