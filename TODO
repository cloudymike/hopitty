Where to start
===============
dataMemcache
   cgibin files adding data
     startreader Done
     recipereader
   remove
     helloPage
     n2
     settings
     ctrlform (manual)
     ctrlset (manual)
   scan for memcache in all other modules
   
   Non cgibin file 
     scan for memcache?
     scan for pickle

Create a maintenance programs module that is similar to recipeliststatus, but
reading the json files instead.

Add test button to runcontrol page. This will do a quick run and reality check of the recipe.

Better testing
    Data module, as described above, read write compare...
    Create test for recipelist module. Take a snapshot of current recipe module and
        write nosetest.
    quick scan of all recipes in my homedirectory. This will be a non-required 
        test so questionable if it is part of checkall.

coverage
  covertests
  Start with all files not listed, should they be removed?
  Create a nosetests only option of covertests
  Identify lines not covered, add nosetests or remove or mark as not testable
     hardware lines. try to minimize the amount


====== Laidback work =====
Remove unused code
    Commented out code
    import statements with yellow triangle

pepme

Increase coverage     
    
    
 
====== Less immediate =====
stages should probably be a class
Look for unused code as includes etc.




====== Post brew issues and observations =======

brew 130309
After brew is done programs exit, where?

stages page has a links for number, why?
DTHe blue on green does not work.




after brew 130202
Post cleaning not working as it relies on scale.

after brew 130126
Add a link to gravity/temperature calculator on the web

Add key mashing data to mash status page from recipe
  Equipment temperature
  (mash schedule..)

====== To Fix =======
refactoring
  stages class ( & module)

refactoring
  runctrl.py, breakout as a def or class
  Should be possible to call (as needed when recipelist is done

Break out getop and use an options dictionary

How to start a brew?

cloudrecipe.py as standalone exec

Add the user for the path to the home dir bsmx file as an input option
to recipeScanner

===== Hardware Issues =====
Hardware are sometimes failing at startup. Test this in loop.

X10 controller hangs at startup at times. Debug this. It seems like a reboot
fixes the problem.

Consider create a HW check mode, that will fail if not all hardware sensors and 
controllers are OK


==== Checks =====
  mutex (link to other controller that should NOT be activated at same time)
  max values (as pump volume)
  Timeouts?
  watch dogs? Water checks?


==== Unknown ====
dict_.get('key2', "Key doesn't exist")

Watchdog to shut all down?
