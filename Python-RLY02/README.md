The relays are identified by 1 and 2 and the allowed actions are on, off and click. 
You can interact with them with things like:

## Swith relay 1 on ##
python rly02.py -r 1 -a on

## Swith relay 2 off ##
python rly02.py -r 1 -a off

## Click relay 1 (on and off) ##
python rly02.py -r 1 -a click

## Read relay states ##
python rly02.py -s
