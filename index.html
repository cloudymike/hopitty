        <h3>Welcome to Hopitty, the fully automatic personal brewery</h3>

<p>The intention of this project is to create brewing software that enables full grain brewing, and doing so fully automatically. The basic setup assumes an electric hot water tun, cooler mash tun and and a electric boiler. All sensors and controllers are USB based, and in general all USB devices has source code for drivers. Hopitty reads Beersmith recipes directly, (bxml files) but recipes can also be read from json files. The user interfaces is web based, to allow you to check the status of the brew from any web browser, rather than just from the computer running the controller.</p>

<p>The software is written in python. Some USB controllers are provided in other languages, as downloaded from the vendor. The code was written and tested on and Ubuntu PC.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<h4>One recipe controller</h4>

<p>The one recipe controller will run interactively by loading a recipe on the command line. It is great for testing and for running a single recipe.</p>

<h1>How to run</h1>

<p>cd src</p>

<p>For one recipe run:
./runctrl.py -f ../recipes/something</p>

<p>Reading all beersmith recipes:
./runscan.py</p>

<p>Got to web page:
http://localhost</p>

<h1>Web pages</h1>

<p>(This may change)
The web pages are independent of the controller and communicates
with memcache</p>

<p>The scripts are mainly status script with addition of, when using runscan.py,
allowing for selection of recipe and start a run</p>

<p>To install cgi-bin scripts, cd into src/cgibin and type sudo INSTALL</p>

<p>Note cgi-bin is not a valid python module name so the dir needs to be cgibin.
Otherwise many things will break including nosetests.</p>

<h1>How to build</h1>

<p>The script SETUP in top dir should install all dependencies and run the tests.
If errors, check the script. It relies on the ability to download from different
vendors.</p>

<p>This script will also setup the required web pages into /var/www</p>

<h1>Testing</h1>

<p>The script checkall should do a comprehensive test. It will run a number of
nose tests and then also a set of functional tests as well as a lint. IF any fails
it will stop the tests.</p>

<h1>Hardware specific code</h1>

<p>There are some code that is not python, that is required to control the hardware.
The code is all compiled within the setup script to allow portability. For details
check the web pages of the vendors. The wget statement in SETUP is a good hint.</p>
