test based on bottle-selenium, from github. 

This requires selenium, and a full graphical environment with firefox.

This is not installed by default. See requirements.txt, that can but use with pip

	# pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the selenium tests:

        # python run_tests.py


It does not seem like you can have multiple tests. 
This seems rather braindead, but for now all tests are in one file
