GoIO Software Development Kit

The GoIO SDK is intended to provide software developers with the ability to access Vernier Software & Technology Go! devices from their own applications. Supported devices include the Go! Motion detector, the Go! Temp thermometer, and the Go! Link sensor interface, which can connect to a variety of analog sensors.

The heart of the SDK is the GoIO_DLL library.
The API to this library is documented in \GoIO_SDK\redist\include\GoIO_DLL_interface.h. The sequence of calls needed to talk to a device is best illustrated by the code in GoIO_DeviceCheck.cpp.

The Windows version of this library is GoIO_DLL.dll. Since GoIO_DLL.dll is a standard Microsoft Windows DLL, you can access the library from a variety of languages including C, C++, Basic, LabView, and Java.

The Apple version of the GoIO_DLL library comes in two different flavors: libGoIO_DLL.dylib and libGoIO_DLL.framework. Both flavors of the library implement exactly the same API. They are just packaged differently as a convenience to users. These libraries can also be accessed from a variety of languages. GoIO_DLL requires Mac OS 10.3.9 or later. Note that libGoIO_DLL.framework is stored in \GoIO_SDK\redist\GoIO_DLL\MacOSX\libGoIO_DLL.framework.zip . You will have to unzip it before you can use it.

The Linux version of the GoIO library just contains the source and the GoIO_DeviceCheck test program to test the library functions, for now.  Follow the INSTALL instructions to get started.
