Version 2.28
Fixed an initialization bug associated with the Vernier Mini Gas Chromatograph(GC) on the Mac.

Version 2.27
Support Vernier Mini Gas Chromatograph(GC).
Add GoIO_DeviceCheck sample code.

Version 2.24
Fixed bug in Mac SDK in which the measurement queue was cleared whenever a STOP command was issued. (RM2846, 20090323)

Version 2.23
Add GoIO_Sensor_SendCmd() and GoIO_Sensor_GetNextResponse() API's. These are advanced API's that should almost never be used. It is generally better to use GoIO_Sensor_SendCmdAndGetResponse() instead.

Version 2.22
Fix a Linux bug that prevented GoLink data collection at rates > 60 hz.

Version 2.21
First release of Go! SDK on linux.

Version 2.20
Fixed a Mac bug which resulted in failure to open a connection to a Go! device connected via a USB hub.

Version 2.19
In order to work around a serious Mac OS 10.4 kernel memory leak (related to HID report writes), I've had to upgrade to HID Interface 122 to get access to the setReport() call. This means we have removed support for 10.2. We now only support 10.3 and higher -- and for best results, we recommend 10.3.9.

Also, upgraded Mac VST_USB to match the head of line logger pro. This includes dynamic HID report-cookie discovery, and better IO failure diagnostics.

Version 2.18
Backed out a workaround for a known Apple memory leak when instantiating a USB plugin interface; the workaround might have been causing some instability, and furthermore was not thread safe. To minimize these leaks, we recommend that Apple clients open and close the device as few times as possible during a session. The Windows code has no known leaks.
Return proper return code from GoIO_Sensor_Unlock().

version 2.17
Allow more than one GoIO_DLL client application to run concurrently and access devices. A given device can only be accessed by a single client.
Fixed more Mac memory leaks.

Version 2.16
Fixed a memory leak on Mac. 
Allow for the fact that the GoLink powers up slowly when opening the device.

Version 2.15
Added support for Intel Macs -- libraries are in Universal Binary format.
Fixed a memory leak on Mac.

version 2.12
More minor tweaks for the Go! Motion DDS record. Include full source for everything now.
Added libGoIO_DLL.framework.

Version 2.11
Make sure GoIO_Sensor_DDSMem_GetSensorNumber() always reports the correct sensor number for Go! Motion.
Fix bad data in the DDS record for Go! Motion.

Version 2.10
Improved performance on slow systems.

Version 2.0:
Added support for Mac OS 10.2 and later.
Added support for Go! Motion.
Added GoIO_GetDLLVersion() API.

version 1.6:
The entry point names to GoIO_DLL.dll were mangled in C++ style in earlier versions. Version 1.6 does not
export mangled names, so the Win32 function GetProcAddress(hModule, "GoIO_Sensor_Open") should succeed now.
