The SDK includes complete source code in C++. You are free to use this code however you like. All the software included in this SDK was written by Vernier Software & Technology(VST), and VST places absolutely no legal restrictions on using the software. You can copy the code, modify it, embed it in your own products, etc.

VST does not guarantee that the code is bug free, but we try to make it so. If you find any bugs, please report them to http://www.vernier.com/tech/supportform.html .

VST would prefer that you not modify GoIO_DLL.dll, libGoIO_DLL.dylib, libGoIO_DLL.framework, or libGoIO. If you do modify any of them, please give your modified version a different name, so we can easily distinguish your version from the VST version.
